## Introduction
This project involved transforming a raw, unstructured sales dataset from WorkNest Supplies into a clean, analysis-ready format. The dataset captured transactional data across multiple regions, customer segments, and product categories. My objective was to clean, enrich, and analyze the data to uncover meaningful business insights and present them in a clear, interactive dashboard.

## Key Metrics
- Total Revenue Earned After Discounts
- Number of Orders Placed
- Average Delivery Time
- Customer Satisfaction Rate
- Best-Selling Product Category
- Regional Revenue Distribution
- Orders by Customer Segment
- Top Performing States by Order Volume
- Monthly Sales Trend Analysis

## Skills Demonstrated
This project allowed me to apply a wide range of Excel skills:

- **Data Cleaning & Structuring**:I removed empty rows, columns, and duplicates, applied formatting functions like TRIM() and PROPER(), and reordered columns to improve narrative flow.
- **Data Enrichment**:Using VLOOKUP() and XLOOKUP(), I retrieved customer and product names from lookup tables to make the dataset more informative.
- **Date Formatting & Extraction**:I cleaned inconsistent date formats using Text to Columns and extracted Month, Year, and Weekday using TEXT() formulas for time-based analysis.
- **Calculated Fields**:I created nine new columns to support deeper analysis, including Total Price (Before & After Discount), Discount Amount, Days to Ship, Revenue per Unit, Discount %, Shipping Speed Category, Order Value Category, and Discount Level.
- **Pivot Tables & Charts** :I built dynamic Pivot Tables to summarize sales by region, product category, customer segment, and time. These were visualized using bar, column, and line charts.
- **Dashboard Design**:I designed a clean, user-friendly dashboard with slicers for Region and Customer Segment, making it easy to filter and explore the data interactively.
